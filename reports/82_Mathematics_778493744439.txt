Teacher Report:  
- **Average score**: The overall average is only 22.38 % (average_submitted ≈ 82 % on the few graded tasks), indicating substantial difficulty achieving the expected learning outcomes.  
- **Submission habits**: 12 of 15 assignments are missing and one is late; only three assignments have been graded, reflecting a very low completion rate.  
- **Strengths/Successes**: The student performed strongly on the class activities (28/30 and 30/30) and the Chapter 7 Quiz (19/34), showing capacity for higher performance when engaged.  
- **Risks/learning gaps**: The high number of missing assignments, coupled with a low overall average, points to disengagement, possible time‑management issues, or lack of support for the more complex quizzes.  
- **Recommended strategies**:  
  - Implement a structured assignment‑tracking system with reminders and incentives for submission.  
  - Offer targeted tutoring or peer‑study sessions focused on quiz preparation.  
  - Set short, incremental goals with immediate feedback to rebuild confidence.  
  - Engage the student in a one‑on‑one meeting to identify any external barriers and create a personalized action plan.
