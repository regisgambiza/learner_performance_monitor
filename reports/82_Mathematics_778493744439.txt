Teacher Report:
Category: At Risk  
Teacher Report:  
- Overall average of 37.22 % (including non‑submissions) indicates significant academic struggles, well below the 50 % threshold for safe completion.  
- Submission habits are problematic: 11 of 15 assignments are missing with no late submissions, demonstrating a lack of engagement and time‑management issues.  
- Strengths are limited to recent submissions where the student achieved near‑perfect scores (31/34, 28/30, 30/30, 26/26), showing potential capability once the assignment is received.  
- Risks are high: the volume of missing work creates large learning gaps, especially in foundational concepts covered in the early assignments; the student is at serious risk of falling behind in all subsequent content.  
- Recommended strategies: initiate an immediate intervention plan—schedule a meeting with the student and parents, set up a structured study schedule, provide access to tutoring or supplemental resources, and monitor weekly progress; consider reducing the assignment load temporarily to prevent overwhelm and re‑introduce missing work incrementally.

Teacher Report:
Category: Emerging  
Teacher Report:  
- Average score: 59.2% falls into the emerging band (50–65%), indicating that the student is achieving below the expected level for the curriculum but still above the threshold for at‑risk status.  
- Submission habits: 2 assignments missing (10.2 and 9.1 Functions) and no late submissions; the missing work, particularly the missing “9.1 Functions,” contributes to the lower overall average.  
- Strengths: Strong performance on several quizzes and class activities (e.g., 10/10 on “9.3 Changing the subject,” 24/30 on “7.3 Multiplying and dividing…”) shows the ability to excel when focused on specific topics.  
- Risks/learning gaps: The extremely low score on “Chapter 8 Quiz” (1/20) signals a critical gap in foundational skills; the missing “10.2 Multiplying and dividing integers by fractions” also suggests a broader issue with fraction‑integer operations.  
- Recommended strategies: Implement a personalized remediation plan focusing on fractions and basic operations, schedule regular check‑ins to monitor progress, provide differentiated assignments to bridge the gap, and encourage the use of formative assessment tools (e.g., quick quizzes) to track improvements before moving on to higher‑level content.

Teacher Report:
Category: Average
Teacher Report:
- The average score of 82.85% indicates solid overall academic performance but falls short of the 90% threshold for High Performer status, reflecting consistent but not exceptional mastery across the course.
- Submission habits are exemplary, with zero missing or late assignments, ensuring full credit for all graded work and maintaining high engagement.
- Strengths are evident in consistently high scores on most quizzes and class activities (e.g., 30/30 on Chapter 9 Quiz, 32/32 on 10.2, and 27/30 on 7.3 activity), indicating strong conceptual understanding and effective test-taking strategies.
- The primary risk is the significant dip in performance on the Chapter 8 Quiz (5/20) and the 8.1/8.2/8.3 assignments where the student consistently scored 10/10 but the quiz reveals difficulty with data interpretation and application of concepts; this suggests a potential gap in practical application of statistical methods.
- Recommended strategies include targeted mini‑lessons on data interpretation and quiz‑style practice for Chapter 8 content, formative checks (e.g., exit tickets) focused on functions and data analysis, and peer‑review sessions to reinforce learning from lower‑scoring assignments.

Student: Mayra Booncharoen
Student ID: 115586089465371277310
Teacher Report:
Category: At Risk  
Teacher Report:  
- Average score (overall): 49.84 %—well below the 75 % threshold, indicating significant learning gaps and overall low performance.  
- Submission habits: 8 missing out of 15 assignments (53 % missing) and no late submissions; the high number of missed tasks directly contributes to the low average and reflects a lack of consistent engagement.  
- Strengths/Successes: Demonstrated strong mastery in several class activities, scoring 29/30 on “7.3 Multiplying and dividing with integers and decimals” and 29/30 on “7.2 Rounding to significant figures”; also achieved perfect scores on “7.1 Multiplying and Dividing by 0.1 and 0.01.”  
- Risks/Learning Gaps: The student performed poorly on several quizzes (e.g., 4/20 on Chapter 8 Quiz, 22/30 on Chapter 9 Quiz) and did not submit major instructional assignments (e.g., 10.2, 10.1, 9.3–9.1). The cumulative effect of missed assignments and low quiz scores signals a risk of falling behind core content.  
- Recommended Strategies:  
  - Implement a structured check‑in system (e.g., weekly submission reminders) to reduce missed work.  
  - Offer targeted remediation for quiz content (e.g., small group review sessions focused on Chapter 8 concepts).  
  - Provide additional practice assignments with immediate feedback to reinforce skills that appeared weak.  
  - Consider a progress‑monitoring plan that tracks assignment completion and quiz performance over time to ensure steady improvement.

Student: Haruto Ito
Student ID: 116499323632292936104
Teacher Report:
Category: Average  
Teacher Report:  
- Haruto’s overall average score of 80.58 % reflects solid understanding across most units, yet indicates a need for continued focus on areas that consistently fall below 70 %.  
- His submission habits are exemplary: 15/15 assignments completed on time with no late or missing work, demonstrating strong organizational skills.  
- Strengths are evident in the consistently high scores on chapter quizzes (e.g., 29/30 on “7.3 Class Activity”) and perfect scores on data‑representation tasks (e.g., 8.3, 8.2, 8.1). These results suggest strong conceptual grasp of data analysis and activity-based learning.  
- The primary learning gaps appear in the lower‑scoring items: 6/12 on “9.1 Functions,” 19/30 on “Chapter 9 Quiz,” and several scores in the 68–70 % range. These point to potential weaknesses in function interpretation and fraction‑integer operations.  
- Recommended strategies: implement targeted review sessions focusing on functions and integer/fraction multiplication, use differentiated worksheets to reinforce concepts, encourage reflective self‑assessment after each quiz, and provide optional tutoring or study groups for students needing extra practice.

Teacher Report:  
- Average score: Umarin’s overall average is 36.25 %, indicating significant difficulty meeting course standards and a need for immediate academic support.  
- Submission habits: He missed 5 out of 15 assignments (none late), which is a substantial proportion of the workload and limits the opportunity to improve his overall standing.  
- Strengths: Several quizzes and class activities demonstrate potential, with scores such as 12/20, 13/34, 16/30, and perfect 10/10s on data‑visualization tasks, showing that when he engages he can perform well.  
- Risks/learning gaps: The low average and high missing count suggest gaps in foundational concepts, especially in early unit content (e.g., Chapter 9 and Chapter 10 quizzes). His inconsistent performance could also stem from time‑management or comprehension issues.  
- Recommended strategies:  
  - Provide targeted tutoring on key topics where he scored low, using scaffolded practice activities.  
  - Implement a check‑in system to ensure he submits assignments on time; consider short, formative quizzes to reinforce learning.  
  - Encourage use of the study‑skills guide (e.g., note‑taking, review sheets) and schedule a meeting with the student to identify personal barriers.  
  - Offer extra credit or revised assignments for missed work, with clear deadlines, to improve completion rates.

Teacher Report:
Category: Needs Review  
Teacher Report:  
- Average score: Apivit’s average is 0 %, reflecting no recorded grades and a complete lack of assessment data.  
- Submission habits: He has not submitted any of the 15 assignments, indicating either disengagement, absence, or significant external barriers.  
- Strengths: No measurable academic strengths are evident from the data; all assignments are missing.  
- Risks/learning gaps: The complete absence of submitted work places him at high risk for falling behind and potentially failing the course; the lack of data precludes a precise assessment of skill gaps.  
- Recommended strategies:  
  - Initiate urgent communication with the student (and guardians, if appropriate) to determine reasons for non‑submission and to assess attendance.  
  - Schedule an intake meeting with the teacher to discuss potential accommodations, learning support, or personal issues.  
  - Provide a clear, actionable plan for catching up, including deadlines for submitting overdue assignments and access to additional resources.  
  - Monitor progress closely; if the student remains non‑responsive, involve the school’s counseling or intervention team.

Teacher Report:
Category: Improving  
Teacher Report:  
- Average score 68% falls in the 65–75% range, indicating moderate performance with notable room for growth.  
- Submission habits show one missing assignment (Chapter 8 Quiz) but no late submissions; consistency could be improved with stronger follow‑through on missing work.  
- Strengths include solid performance on several 10/10 assignments and a recent upward trend in activity scores (21/30 and 19/30), reflecting potential improvement over time.  
- Risks involve lower scores on the Chapter 10 Quiz (13/20) and the 16/32 fraction problem, pointing to conceptual challenges with fractions and mixed numbers; the missing Quiz may signal disengagement or external barriers.  
- Recommended strategies: provide targeted fraction‑practice worksheets, schedule one‑on‑one check‑ins to address missing work, set up a reward system for timely submissions, and incorporate brief formative checks to monitor progress in weaker areas.

Teacher Report:
Category: Improving  
Teacher Report:  
- The student’s average score of 74.4 % is solid but falls just below the 75 % threshold needed for the “Average” category, indicating room for growth.  
- Submission habits are exemplary: 0 missing and 0 late assignments, demonstrating strong organizational skills.  
- Strengths include perfect scores on key assessments (Chapter 9 Quiz 30/30, several 10/10 assignments) and consistent high performance in later units (8.* and 9.* topics).  
- Risks/learning gaps arise from low marks on early work (e.g., 3/25 on “10.1 Subtracting mixed numbers,” 3/12 on “9.1 Functions”) and moderate scores on some quizzes (Chapter 10 Quiz 14/20, Chapter 8 Quiz 13/20).  
- Recommended strategies:  
  * Focus review sessions on the units with lower scores (Chapter 10, 9.1, 10.1).  
  * Use targeted practice problems and peer‑teaching opportunities to reinforce concepts that were weak.  
  * Encourage reflective journaling on learning strategies after each quiz to promote self‑regulation.  
  * Schedule a one‑to‑one check‑in to discuss specific difficulties and set short‑term improvement goals.

Teacher Report:
Category: At Risk  
Teacher Report:  
- The student’s overall average of 39.2 % is well below the 50 % threshold, signaling significant academic challenges.  
- Submission habits show 2 missing assignments (10.1 Subtracting mixed numbers, 7.1 Multiplying and Dividing by 0.1 and 0.01) and no late submissions, yet the missing work contributes to a low overall average.  
- Strengths: Consistent high performance on several tasks (10/10 on 9.3 and 9.2, 10/10 on 8.3–8.1, and 27/30 on “7.2 Rounding to significant figures”). These demonstrate potential in specific content areas.  
- Risks/learning gaps: Poor outcomes on multiple critical assessments (Chapter 10 Quiz 10/20, Chapter 9 Quiz 3/30, Chapter 8 Quiz 6/20, Chapter 7 Quiz 9/34) and low scores on foundational topics (2/32 on “10.2 Multiplying and dividing integers by fractions,” 1/12 on “9.1 Functions”). Missing assignments further expose gaps in content mastery.  
- Recommended strategies:  
  * Implement a structured remediation plan focused on the lowest‑scoring areas (fractions, integers, functions).  
  * Provide scaffolded practice and formative quizzes to build confidence before re‑assessing.  
  * Offer supplemental resources (online tutorials, office‑hour appointments) to address missed work.  
  * Monitor progress with weekly checkpoints and adjust instruction based on formative assessment data.  
  * Engage parents/guardians in a communication plan to support homework completion and study habits at home.

Teacher Report:
Category: Improving  
Teacher Report:  
- Average score of 71.2 % indicates moderate proficiency; the student is progressing but still below the benchmark for consistent high performance.  
- Submission habits show two missing assignments (10.1 Subtracting mixed numbers and 9.1 Functions) but no late submissions; overall completion is solid, yet there is room for improving punctuality and consistency.  
- Strengths are evident in the numerous perfect 10/10 scores on data representation tasks and solid quiz results (e.g., 24/30 on Chapter 9 Quiz, 28/34 on Chapter 7 Quiz), demonstrating strong conceptual grasp in those areas.  
- Risks include the lower scores on “Chapter 8 Quiz” (13/20) and “7.1 Multiplying and Dividing by 0.1 and 0.01” (14/26), as well as the two missing assignments, which suggest gaps in mixed‑number operations and function concepts.  
- Recommended strategies: implement a reminder system for missing work, schedule targeted review sessions on mixed numbers and functions, use formative quizzes to track progress, and provide peer‑led study groups to reinforce learning and increase engagement.
