Teacher Report:
Category: At Risk  
Teacher Report:  
- Average score: The overall average of 22.4 % (based on all 15 assignments) indicates a significant gap between expected and achieved learning outcomes.  
- Submission habits: Amelia has 12 missing assignments and only 3 graded submissions, with 1 late entry. The high number of non‑submissions severely impacts her overall standing.  
- Strengths/Successes: In the few graded tasks, she scored 100 % on “7.2 Rounding to significant figures” and 93 % on “7.3 Multiplying and dividing with integers and decimals – Class Activity,” showing strong conceptual understanding when engaged.  
- Risks/Learning gaps: Missing critical assessments such as the Chapter 10 Quiz and several chapter quizzes, combined with a low overall average, highlights a risk of falling further behind, especially if this pattern continues.  
- Recommended strategies:  
  - Implement a personalized follow‑up plan to address missed assignments, including scheduled reminders and brief one‑on‑one check‑ins.  
  - Use the high‑scoring assignments as modeling examples; have Amelia lead brief peer‑teaching sessions on those topics.  
  - Provide targeted intervention resources (e.g., supplemental practice sheets, online tutorials) focused on the areas covered in the missing quizzes.  
  - Monitor progress weekly, adjusting the intervention plan based on her submission rate and assignment quality.
