Teacher Report:
Category: At Risk  
Teacher Report:  
- The overall average score of **22.38 %** across all assignments indicates a significant performance gap that requires immediate attention.  
- Submission habits reveal **12 missing** assignments and **1 late** submission out of 15 total, showing a strong pattern of disengagement or difficulty meeting deadlines.  
- **Strengths** are evident in the two class‑activity submissions (28/30 and 30/30), demonstrating the student’s ability to achieve high scores when actively engaged and supported.  
- **Risks** include the low overall average, the high missing‑assignment count, and the fact that only **3 assignments** have been graded, limiting the data available to assess learning progress.  
- **Recommended strategies**:  
  - Establish a clear, monitored accountability plan (e.g., due‑date reminders, check‑ins).  
  - Provide targeted remedial support focused on quiz content and foundational concepts.  
  - Offer additional resources (e.g., study guides, tutoring sessions).  
  - Schedule regular one‑on‑one meetings to discuss challenges and set short‑term goals.  
  - Encourage the student to engage with the two high‑scoring activity formats as a model for future assignments.
