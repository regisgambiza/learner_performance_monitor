Teacher Report:  
- The overall average score of 82% indicates solid academic performance, meeting the “Average” threshold of 75‑<90% and suggesting consistent competency across most assignments.  
- Submission habits are strong: only 1 assignment was missing and none were late, reflecting reliable engagement and time management.  
- Strengths are evident in high scoring on quizzes (e.g., Chapter 10 Quiz 28/29, 10.2 Multiplying a constant over a bracket 31/31) and class activity tasks, indicating strong conceptual understanding and calculation accuracy.  
- A risk area is the lower performance on the Chapter 8 Quiz (10/13) and the single missed assignment (11.2 Angles in a quadrilateral), which could signal gaps in geometry application that may become problematic if not addressed.  
- Recommended strategies include targeted review sessions focusing on geometry concepts, especially angles and their applications, and encouraging the student to seek clarification on any misunderstood quiz material to maintain consistency across all units.

Teacher Report:
Category: Improving  
Teacher Report:  
- Average Score: The overall average (including missed work) is 73.13 %, indicating the student is on the cusp of the “Average” range but currently classified as “Improving” due to some lower scores.  
- Submission Habits: 2 of 19 assignments were missing (no late submissions). While the completion rate is acceptable, the missing work (including a zero‑score or 0/30 treated as non‑submission) reduces overall performance.  
- Strengths: Consistently high scores on most quizzes and activities (e.g., 28/29, 29/31, 30/30, 36/36) demonstrate strong conceptual understanding when engaged.  
- Risks / Gaps: Lower scores on a few key assessments (6/13 on Chapter 8 Quiz, 5/18 on 12.2 Averages) reveal difficulties with specific content areas and potential gaps in applying concepts to new problems.  
- Recommended Strategies:  
  - Targeted review sessions focusing on topics with lower scores (averages, probability, and certain geometry problems).  
  - Structured peer‑tutoring or small‑group workshops to reinforce understanding of challenging concepts.  
  - Encourage consistent submission by setting up reminders and checking deadlines early.  
  - Provide formative quizzes that mimic the style of the low‑scoring assignments to build confidence and track progress.

Teacher Report:
Category: At Risk  
Teacher Report:  
- The overall average score of 35.75 % (average across all 19 assignments) is well below the 50 % threshold, indicating significant academic difficulty.  
- Submission habits show a high missing rate: 9 of 19 assignments were not submitted (none were late), which severely limits learning continuity and mastery of key concepts.  
- Strengths are evident in geometry and fraction work; scores of 16/18 (Angles & parallel lines), 24/30 (Adding Mixed Numbers), and 27/36 (Multiplying and dividing proper fractions) suggest potential that can be built upon with focused support.  
- Risks include the lack of completion of critical quizzes (Chapter 12, Chapter 11, Chapter 9), which hinders assessment of foundational knowledge, and inconsistent performance on other assignments (e.g., 5/15 on Chapter 11 Quiz).  
- Recommended strategies: implement a structured assignment completion plan, provide targeted remediation for missing quizzes, use formative checks to reinforce concepts, schedule regular check‑ins to monitor progress, and offer small‑group tutoring focused on geometry and basic arithmetic skills.

Teacher Report:
Category: Average  
Teacher Report:  
- The student’s overall average score of 77.1% indicates solid academic performance, though it falls short of the high‑performer threshold.  
- Submission habits are largely reliable, with only one missing assignment (Chapter 11 Quiz) and no late submissions; this shows good engagement but also highlights a single lapse that could be addressed.  
- Strengths are evident in consistently high scores on quizzes (e.g., 25/29, 27/30, 28/30) and perfect performance on class activities (10/10), demonstrating strong conceptual understanding and application in practiced contexts.  
- A learning gap appears in the geometry section, specifically the “Angles” set, where scores are slightly lower (e.g., 10/18 and 15/22). The missing Chapter 11 Quiz also suggests a potential area for further review.  
- Recommended strategies include: (1) reinforcing geometry concepts through additional targeted practice, (2) ensuring all quizzes are completed by allocating dedicated study time, and (3) encouraging peer discussion or tutoring for the identified weak areas to sustain and improve overall performance.

Teacher Report:
Category: At Risk  
Teacher Report:  
- The overall average score is 40.65 %, well below the 50 % threshold, indicating significant academic struggles.  
- Submission habits reveal a high missing rate: 7 out of 19 assignments were not submitted, and none of the late submissions are reported, which suggests a consistent pattern of incomplete work.  
- Strengths are limited; the only high-scoring work is the 8.3, 8.2, and 8.1 class activities (all 10/10), showing that the student can perform well when given shorter, guided tasks.  
- Major risks include poor performance on core quizzes (e.g., 1/18 on “12.2 Averages from frequency tables”, 8/13 on “Chapter 8 Quiz”), and the repeated absence of critical assessment work (multiple missing quizzes). These gaps jeopardize mastery of foundational concepts.  
- Recommended strategies: implement a structured accountability system (e.g., check‑in reminders, progress charts), offer targeted intervention sessions focusing on quiz preparation and conceptual understanding, and encourage the use of class activity templates to build confidence before tackling longer assignments.

Category: Improving  
Teacher Report:  
- The student’s overall average of 71.7 % places them above the 65 % threshold for Improvement but below the 75 % threshold for Average, indicating noticeable progress yet room for growth.  
- Submission habits are exemplary: 100 % of assignments were turned in on time with no missing or late work, reflecting strong engagement and organizational skills.  
- Strengths are evident in algebraic manipulation and data representation: high scores on 13.2 (46/48), 10.1 (28/30), 9.2 (33/36), and flawless 10/10 performances on all class‑activity charts. These results demonstrate solid foundational skills.  
- Risks include inconsistency in geometry-related tasks: low marks on angle assignments such as 11.3 (5/18) and 11.1 (12/17) and the notably weak performance on Chapter 8 Quiz (4/13). These gaps suggest difficulty with spatial reasoning and the application of geometric principles.  
- Recommended strategies: implement targeted geometry mini‑units, incorporate immediate feedback through formative quizzes, encourage peer‑teaching sessions on angle concepts, and use visual aids to bridge algebraic–geometric connections.

Student ID: 101538250288741392335
Teacher Report:
Category: Emerging  
Teacher Report:  
- The student’s overall average of 53.3 % falls within the Emerging range (50–65 %) and signals emerging proficiency that requires support to reach competency.  
- Completion habits are a concern: 6 of 19 assignments were missing (≈32 %) and there were no late submissions, indicating potential disengagement or external challenges affecting consistency.  
- Strengths appear when engaged: solid scores on 13.2 (40/48), 10.1 (27/30), 9.2 (20/36), and 25/30 on Chapter 9 Quiz show capacity for algebraic and fraction skills.  
- Risks involve low performance and missing work in key areas—particularly in angle geometry (13.1 6/24, 11.1 12/17, 8.8 8/13) and data interpretation tasks (missing all bar‑chart and table activities). These gaps may hinder overall mastery of the curriculum.  
- Recommended strategies: establish a structured submission plan with reminders, provide targeted remedial lessons on angle geometry and frequency/table interpretation, employ low‑stakes formative checks, offer peer‑support groups, and schedule regular check‑in meetings to address barriers to completion.

Student: Klakoon Younglure
Student ID: 108604805771259650789
Teacher Report:
Category: Improving  
Teacher Report:  
- Average score: Klakoon’s overall average of 65.9 % (65.9 % of total possible points) signals that the student is progressing toward competency but still below the 75 % threshold; continued focus on mastery is required.  
- Submission habits: With only 2 assignments missing and no late submissions, Klakoon demonstrates reliable engagement, though the missing work may reflect specific challenges that need to be addressed.  
- Strengths / successes: Recent high‑scoring work—30/30 on “10.1 Simplifying expressions,” 34/36 on “9.2 Multiplying and dividing proper fractions,” and 26/29 on “Chapter 10 Quiz”—shows solid understanding of algebraic manipulation and number sense. The perfect scores on the class activity quizzes also indicate good mastery of the basic concepts taught in those units.  
- Risks / learning gaps: Earlier work shows lower performance, such as 6/18 on “12.2 Averages from frequency tables,” 8/17 on “12.1 Mean, median, mode and range,” and 8/15 on “Chapter 11 Quiz.” These inconsistencies point to gaps in foundational skills, especially in data interpretation and early geometry.  
- Recommended strategies:  
  - Targeted review sessions focusing on the lower‑scoring topics (e.g., averages, mean/mode, geometry fundamentals).  
  - Structured peer‑learning or study‑group checkpoints to reinforce concepts.  
  - Incremental goal‑setting after each quiz, with immediate feedback to maintain momentum.  
  - Use formative assessments (e.g., quick quizzes or exit tickets) to monitor understanding before moving to the next unit.  
  - Encourage self‑reflection on missed assignments to identify personal barriers (time‑management, misconceptions, etc.).

Student: Arkira Anuttaraumphi
Student ID: 103866569725770440543
Teacher Report:
Category: At Risk  
Teacher Report:  
- Average score: Arkira’s overall average of 14.7 % indicates severe underperformance and falls well below the 50 % threshold, signaling an urgent need for intervention.  
- Submission habits: Eleven out of nineteen assignments are missing, and there are no late submissions. This high rate of non‑submission suggests disengagement, possible external barriers, or a mismatch between instructional pacing and student readiness.  
- Strengths / successes: Among the few completed assignments, Arkira achieved modest scores on “9.1 Adding Mixed Numbers” (13/30) and “9.2 Multiplying and dividing proper fractions” (12/36). These relatively better performances highlight potential in procedural math if reinforced.  
- Risks / learning gaps: The majority of completed work shows low scores (e.g., 8/24 on “13.1 Order of operations,” 4/17 on “12.1 Mean, median, mode and range,” 1/18 on “11.3 Angles and parallel lines”), and the missing assignments cover critical foundational units. The pattern indicates gaps in both content knowledge and homework completion, increasing the risk of falling further behind.  
- Recommended strategies:  
  - Conduct a one‑to‑one diagnostic assessment to identify specific conceptual misunderstandings and personal barriers.  
  - Develop a structured attendance/participation plan that includes frequent check‑ins and accountability for assignment completion.  
  - Provide scaffolded support, such as simplified worksheets or step‑by‑step guides, to build confidence in key areas (operations, geometry, data interpretation).  
  - Offer extra help sessions (after‑school or virtual tutoring) focusing on the most problematic units.  
  - Engage parents/guardians in a collaborative action plan to support homework habits and monitor progress.  
  - Utilize formative, low‑stakes quizzes to give Arkira frequent feedback and reduce the intimidation factor of larger assignments.

Student: Jacob Phanudet Briffa
Student ID: 106520656215727230092
Teacher Report:
Category: At Risk  
Teacher Report:  
- Average score: The overall average of 19.16 (≈30–35 % of total possible points) indicates a significant performance gap, well below the 50 % threshold for At Risk status.  
- Submission habits: Six assignments are marked missing, with no late submissions. The high number of non‑submissions, combined with a graded count of only 13 out of 19 assignments, reflects inconsistent engagement.  
- Strengths / successes: Jacob achieved a perfect score on the “8.3 Frequency diagrams for continuous data – Class Activity” (10/10), showing potential for applied data tasks when fully engaged.  
- Risks / learning gaps: Multiple low‑scoring submissions (e.g., 1/18 on averages, 2/31 on constant multiplication, 5/13 on bar charts) highlight difficulty with foundational concepts. The absence of recent improvement trends and the high number of missing assignments signal a risk of falling further behind.  
- Recommended strategies:  
  - Schedule a one‑on‑one meeting to assess barriers to completion (e.g., time management, resource access).  
  - Implement a structured submission calendar and reminders for upcoming work.  
  - Provide targeted remediation sessions focusing on low‑scoring topics (fractions, averages, algebraic manipulation).  
  - Offer formative quizzes to build confidence before larger assessments.  
  - Encourage peer‑study groups to enhance engagement and accountability.
