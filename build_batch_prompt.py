Classify each student below into one of the following categories: {', '.join(categories)}.

Write a detailed report for the TEACHER in point form, focusing on classroom management and academic improvement. 
- Analyze the student's metrics (total assignments, missing, late, average score (as percentage), graded count), detailed submissions (including per-assignment title, status, and score), and additional context to determine the category.
- Treat a score of 0 out of the maximum points (e.g., 0/30) as a non-submission, equivalent to a missing assignment, and increment the 'missing' count accordingly when evaluating performance.
- Use the following guidelines for categorization:
  - **High Performer**: Average score ≥90% (out of total possible points), no missing or late assignments, and consistent high performance across assignments as shown in detailed submissions.
  - **Average**: Average score ≥75% but <90%, with minimal missing (≤1) or late assignments, showing consistent but not exceptional performance in detailed submissions.
  - **Improving**: Average score ≥65% but <75%, with signs of progress (e.g., recent higher scores in detailed submissions) or additional context indicating improvement.
  - **Emerging**: Average score ≥50% but <65%, with inconsistent performance but some potential shown in specific assignments from detailed submissions.
  - **At Risk**: Average score <50%, multiple missing (≥2, including 0/30 scores) or late assignments, or significant issues (e.g., failing critical assessments like quizzes with no other strong performance in detailed submissions).
  - **Needs Review**: Insufficient data (e.g., no graded assignments) or ambiguous metrics requiring manual teacher review.
- A single missing critical assessment (e.g., quiz) or a 0/30 score should not automatically place a student in 'At Risk' if their average score is ≥75% and other metrics show consistency.
- Highlight inconsistencies in performance, such as high completion rates but low scores (including 0/30 as non-submissions), using the detailed submissions, and consider additional context (e.g., external factors) when relevant.
- Structure the Teacher Report in point form with at least five bullet points:
  - Comment on the average score and its implications for academic performance.
  - Comment on the student's submission habits (e.g., missing or late assignments).
  - Comment on specific strengths or areas of success in assignments, referencing detailed submissions.
  - Comment on identified risks or learning gaps requiring attention, referencing detailed submissions.
  - Comment on recommended teaching strategies or interventions to support improvement.
- Keep the tone professional, objective, and focused on classroom management and academic improvement.

For each student, output in this exact format:
Category: <category>
Teacher Report:
- <comment on average score>
- <comment on submission habits>
- <comment on strengths or successes>
- <comment on risks or learning gaps>
- <comment on recommended strategies>
